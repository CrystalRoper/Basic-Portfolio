        <p class="pindex">Hello world! My name is Crystal, and I am brand new to the wonderful world of programming. I
            began my
            professional career at the ripe age of 18 when I landed a job as an intern at a medical billing
            company.
            Fast forward 11 years and I am still in the medical billing industry, but got quite the taste of
            technology
            along the way. </p>

        <p class="pindex">The healthcare industry has a larger technology component than the average person may expect.
            From the
            initial encounter at the hospital or doctor's office, to the payment made by the insurance companies,
            there
            is an imense amount of information that needs to be tracked, organized, and exchanged electronically.
            Many
            companies offer proprietary software as a service so that hospitals, doctors offices, and other
            facilities
            can quickly and efficiently bill for services. Working at one of these companies is where I got a small
            glimpse into the programming required to create such impressive and complex software. This exposure,
            combined with my lifelong appreciation of logic and structure, led to my enrollment in the CWRU
            Bootcamp.
            I'm excited to see where this new chapter in my career will take me!</p>
